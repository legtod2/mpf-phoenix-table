Go here to download the cobrapin stm32 configs
https://github.com/cobra18t/CobraPin/tree/main/OPP%20Config 
Download CobraPinBoard0.py 
Download CobraPin_board1_Standard.py

There are two processor boards on the CobraPin with the board numbers labeled on silkscreen under the boards. Board 0 is the upper board and Board 1 is the lower board. Each board requires a different config and should not be swapped without re-configuring OPP.

Putting a Board 1 config in a Board 0 slot could result in blown FETs, coils, or fuses. A Board 0 config should also not go in the Board 1 slot. Proceed with caution!
Board 0

Regular: Neopixels on J11 that glow dimly blue at power-on. The purpose of glowing dimly is to verify at a glance that all pixels are operating properly even before MPF takes control of the lights.

NoGlow: Neopixels on J11 will stay off at power up.
Board 1

There are 3 variants for Board 1. By default, all of them have neopixels on J12 that glow dimly blue at power-on. The purpose of glowing dimly is to verify at a glance that all pixels are operating properly even before MPF takes control of the lights. Each variant also has a NoGlow option.

Standard: Includes the standard active-low matrix for 64 matrix switches and 22 direct inputs.

Direct: No matrix for a total of 38 direct inputs on the CobraPin.

HighMatrix: Includes an active-high matrix for 64 matrix switches and 22 direct inputs. 
Loading the Config

The OPP Config Process consists of establishing comms, erasing the existing config, loading/saving the new config, and verifying the new config.

Since CobraPin relies on processor board serial numbers to address the boards, use Gen2Test to load the serial number. The serial should be the board number (0,1,2, etc.).

As an example, here is the command sequence to load the regular config into Board 0. You may have a different port name.
